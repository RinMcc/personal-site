At Stripe I resolved some of Stripe's largest users issues, trained 1000+ new hires on the product I was an SME for, built tools and knowledge bases to help support agents resolve user issues quickly and correctly. If you think I can be helpful to you or would like to meet me, please feel free to get in touch.\n# Currently\n\nI'm currently refreshing my engineering and development skills by building this website, completing [Harvards CS50](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/) as well as some [Code with Mosh](https://codewithmosh.com/courses/) courses. \n\n# I like\n\n- running\n- football\n- skiing\n- sailing and the sea\n- space / astronomy\n- books - let me know if you have any recommendations\n- podcasts ([The Daily](https://www.nytimes.com/column/the-daily), [Planet Money](https://www.npr.org/sections/money/), [The Economist](http://radio.economist.com/), [HubermanLab](https://hubermanlab.com/category/podcast-episodes/),  and others)\n- [Good design](/personal-site/)\n\n# Fun facts\n\n- I previously played football for an academy that allowed me to compete internationally.\n- I've snorkeled with Whale Sharks, Black-tip Reef Shark, Eagle Ray and Oceanic Manta. \n- at one point I had memorized every flag and capital city in the world. I'm still pretty good with flags but have forgotten a lot of those city combo's.\n- my family, on my Mom's side, operated the first and only record pressing company in Ireland - Carlton Productions. \n\n# I dream of\n\n- always finding inspiration.\n- doing better.\n- seeing wild Rhino, Tigers and snorkelling with more marine life.\n",h=d.split(/\s+/).map((function(e){return e.replace(/\W/g,"")})).filter((function(e){return e.length})).length,p=function(e){var n=Object.assign({},((0,s.Z)(e),e));return(0,c.jsx)(a.rU,(0,o.Z)({},n))};n.default=function(){return(0,c.jsx)(l.Z,{title:"About",description:"Learn about Aaron McCarthy",children:(0,c.jsxs)("article",{className:"post markdown",id:"about",children:[(0,c.jsx)("header",{children:(0,c.jsxs)("div",{className:"title",children:[(0,c.jsx)("h2",{"data-testid":"heading",children:(0,c.jsx)(a.rU,{to:"/about",children:"About Me"})}),(0,c.jsxs)("p",{children:["(in about ",h," words)"]})]})}),(0,c.jsx)(i(),{source:d,renderers:{Link:p},escapeHtml:!1})]})})}}}]);
